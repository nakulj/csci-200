    This is the last one where I tell you the problem.  This program
    has the class name different from the file name.  The only difference
    is the lower-case p.  This is to reinforce the requirement that the
    name of the file and the name of the public class must be identical

    The errors you should see are the following:

Lab1P3.java:1: Public class Lab1p3 must be defined in a file called "Lab1p3.java".
public class Lab1p3 {
             ^
1 error

    Note that this error message from the compiler is actually pretty helpful
